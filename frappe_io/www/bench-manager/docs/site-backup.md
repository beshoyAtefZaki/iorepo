# Site Backup

- This doctype contains a list of all the backups present in your bench instance (includes both existent and archived sites).
- Inside each individual docname one can find a Restore button.
- Clicking the Restore button pops up a ui-dialog.
- In this ui-dialog once chose whether to restore the backup either on an existing site or on a new site.

* Want to restore a backup? on a new site or maybe on an existing one? Both scenarios covered!
